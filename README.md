# Energy-Vision


- **Machine Learning Model for Renewable Energy Classification**: Developed a Random Forest model to predict the most suitable renewable energy type (e.g., solar, wind) for a given region using environmental features like temperature, wind speed, and global radiation.
-**Weather Data Integration for Energy Optimization**: Processed and scaled weather data (e.g., pressure, radiation, temperature) to accurately classify optimal renewable energy solutions, improving efficiency in energy resource selection.
-**Web Application for Renewable Energy Recommendations**: Implemented a Flask-based web application to deliver realtime recommendations on the most effective renewable energy type, based on user-input environmental conditions, enhancing accessibility for end-users.
